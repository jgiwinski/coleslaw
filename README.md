Coleslaw is 2011 Front-End's mascot. He was lovingly named by the entire cohort. His full name is Coleslaw Koopa Clancy Iwinski. He lives in Phoenix AZ, but loves to travel to Colorado to ski. This comp is a mock up of Coleslaw's weekly calendar. It documents all the actives he did each day and includes a small caption explaining each activity. 

At the top of the page the user will notice three (currently nonfunctional) buttons. These buttons will take the user to Coleslaw's fanbase, the trends he plans on implementing in the future, and a list of activities his fans wish to see him do. 

The site is responsive and can easily be viewed on a desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile device.
